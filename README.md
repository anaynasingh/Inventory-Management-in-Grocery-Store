# Inventory Management in Grocery Store

Performing exploratory data analysis, using machine learning models, implementing algorithm production and  reviewing algorithm performance. The task was to help Gala Groceries efficiently manage their stocks of items so that there is minimal loss of money and resources.

I completed this project during my Artificial Intelligence Virtual Experience with Cognizant.

## Gala Groceries
Gala Groceries is a technology-led grocery store chain in the USA. They rely heavily on new technologies such as IoT to give them a competetive edge over other grocery stores.

## Perishable Inventory Optimization at Gala Groceries

**Project Overview**

During my Artificial Intelligence Virtual Experience with Cognizant, I participated in a project to optimize inventory management for Gala Groceries, a technology-driven grocery store chain in the USA. 

**Project Scope**

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzed historical sales data, customer behavior, and market trends to identify key patterns and insights.
* **Machine Learning Model Development:** Built and trained predictive models (e.g., time series forecasting, demand forecasting) to forecast demand and optimize stock levels.
* **Model Implementation and Evaluation:** Deployed and monitored the performance of the developed models in a real-world setting.
* **Continuous Improvement:** Regularly reviewed model performance, identified areas for improvement, and refined models to ensure optimal inventory management and minimize waste.

**Key Takeaways**

This project provided valuable experience in applying data science and machine learning techniques to solve a real-world business challenge. Gala Groceries, known for its innovative use of technology like IoT to gain a competitive advantage, presented an exciting opportunity to contribute to their success.
