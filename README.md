# Inventory Management in Grocery Store


**Project Overview**

During my Artificial Intelligence Virtual Experience with Cognizant, I participated in a project to optimize inventory management for Gala Groceries, a technology-driven grocery store chain in the USA. 

**Project Scope**

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzed historical sales data, customer behavior, and market trends to identify key patterns and insights.
* **Machine Learning Model Development:** Built and trained predictive models (e.g., time series forecasting, demand forecasting) to forecast demand and optimize stock levels.
* **Model Implementation and Evaluation:** Deployed and monitored the performance of the developed models in a real-world setting.
* **Continuous Improvement:** Regularly reviewed model performance, identified areas for improvement, and refined models to ensure optimal inventory management and minimize waste.

**Key Takeaways**

This project provided valuable experience in applying data science and machine learning techniques to solve a real-world business challenge. Gala Groceries, known for its innovative use of technology like IoT to gain a competitive advantage, presented an exciting opportunity to contribute to their success.
